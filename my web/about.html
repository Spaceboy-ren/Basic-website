            An otaku who doesn't want to achieve a lot in life, is satisfied by little things. He doesn't want that 1cr package, just wants some time to live his life.
            I tried a lot of stuff in my first sem, I learned a lot through them, I learned how irritating it can be to work with other people, how it just lowers your iq by gazillion times
            I got to know about the things I hate. I am chill and don't give a fuck about fomo.
